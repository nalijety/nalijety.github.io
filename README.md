# Individual Project 1
## Front-end Web Development with a Professional Profile Website on github.io cloud service

## Overview and Requirements 

In this project, I'm honing my front-end web development skills by crafting a Professional Profile Website. Leveraging the github.io cloud service, I'm not only showcasing my expertise but also gaining practical experience in deployment. The project entails meeting both general and technical requisites, from setting up github.io to implementing Bootstrap for a polished portfolio display. JavaScript functionalities are seamlessly integrated to enhance user interaction. At the heart of the website lies the index.html page, meticulously designed with seven tabs catering to various facets of my professional journey. These tabs cover essential sections such as about me, experience, education, skills, interests, certifications, and miscellaneous details, providing visitors with a comprehensive overview of my profile.

### Task 1 : General Requirements
 -I've started my personal website, "nalijety.github.io," with just basic details about me and no fancy design yet. It's like a starting point for me to make it look better and add more cool stuff later on. I'll be adding style and more features to make it a nice place to show off my skills and what I've done.

## Report

You can write a report using Markdown format or any Word processor, i.e., you do not need to use Markdown to write your report. Your report should follow the template/outline provided in Lecture 2 ([https://github.com/phungph-uc/waph/blob/main/README-template.md](https://github.com/phungph-uc/waph/blob/main/README-template.md)) which should include the course name and instructor, your name and email together with your headshot (150x150 pixels), and sub-sections of the assignment's overview, and each task and sub-task.

There should be an overview sub-section where you must write an overview of the assignment and the outcomes you learned from it. Include your website's clickable URL deployed on `github.io`. Also, include a direct clickable link to the project folder on GitHub.com so that it can be viewed when grading, for example, [https://github.com/phungph-uc/waph-phungph/tree/main/individual-project1](https://github.com/phungph-uc/waph-phungph/tree/main/individual-project1).

For each sub-task, write a brief summary of how you complete it. You are welcome to include code snippets and screenshots to demonstrate the outcome, however, they are not required. **Please note that demo screenshots must include your virtual machine name or your name with proper captions and be visible, i.e., in high resolution, not too blurry or with much blank space, for grading**. 

Your report must be exported in  PDF with contents and screenshots are correctly rendered in proper order. The PDF file should be named `your-username-waph-project1.pdf`, e.g., `phungph-waph-project1.pdf`, and uploaded to Canvas to submit by the deadline. 


## Deliverables and Submission

You need to submit **three** deliverables in PDF files for grading:

+ Your report mentioned above.
