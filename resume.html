    <h3>Work Experience</h3>
    <p><b>PROJECT ENGINEER at Ameri Source INC (Sr. Python/AI Engineer)  May 2024 - Present</b>  </p>
    <ul>
        <li><p>Developed and deployed a customized web application using Python Django with client-specific customizations and created a chatbot using LLMs
and streamlined multi-storefront management in a scalable architecture.
          <li><p>Leveraged Python libraries such as NumPy and matplotlib to perform advanced numerical analysis and generate interactive sales and inventory
dashboards, thereby enhancing data visualization efficiency by 30% across key performance metrics.</p></li>
 <li><p>Automated daily inventory reporting with Pandas and SMTP for email notifications while designing a responsive UI with HTML, XHTML, CSS,
JavaScript, and AJAX that reduced page load times by 20% and improved user experience.</p></li>
</p></li>Acquired CSV file, securely stored them in Snowflake, extracted textual content, and converted it into vector embeddings using the OpenAI
embedding model for efficient semantic representation and retrieval.</p></li>
</p></li>Stored vector embeddings in pinecone vector database, applied advanced prompting techniques, and leveraged Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG), agents with OpenAI's GPT model to generate contextually accurate responses and performed fine tuning on the model.</p></li>
</p></li>Integrated AWS S3 and RDS for hosting static assets and databases and employed Python OpenStack APIs and NumPy for demand forecasting
and dynamic pricing models, increasing predictive accuracy by 15% in revenue management.</p></li>
</p></li>Developed and integrated a machine learning recommendation engine that utilized collaborative and content-based filtering; leveraged Scikit-learn
for prototype modeling with KNN and TensorFlow for production-grade deep learning models, resulting in enhanced product recommendations
and increased customer engagement.</p></li>
</p></li>Migrated the Django database from SQLite to PostgreSQL, implemented Docker for containerization, established a CI/CD pipeline with Jenkins
and Git, and built robust RESTful APIs and SOAP-based web services, collectively improving deployment consistency, reducing release cycles
and boosting integration efficiency by 25%.</p></li>
